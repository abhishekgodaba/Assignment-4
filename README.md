# Assignment-4
''' Well, this is my assignment
    It was largely referred (read copied :p) from this website: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/basic_classification
    BTW it was given as one of the links. I am not so sure with python and I've started this assignment on the last day, so I've done very few experiments
    I changed the number of epochs
    First I've put number of epochs to 5
    then i changed it to 3
    I didn't notice much difference in the accuracy
    then i changed it to 8
    A little improvement in accuracy has been observed
    then i changed it to 14
    Accuracy has reached to 1 for the training set and didn't change much for the test set ( a bit of improvement has been observed)
    I wasn't able to change the number of layers since I don't know how to. (I've wasted all my time and was serious only from this week and Im planning to at least complete the next assignment properly :))
    So that's it
